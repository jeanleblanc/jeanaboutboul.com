\resheading{Personal Statement}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{center}
  \parbox{6.762in}{
Since a young age, I have always been passionate about science and learning. This innate curiosity naturally led me to study engineering, with the desire to contribute to a better world through my skills and creativity.\\
Currently a mechanical engineering student at EPFL, I have discovered a particular interest in robotics. This promising field offers numerous application possibilities in various sectors, such as ecology, medicine, and industry. Robotics has the potential to provide innovative and effective solutions to concrete problems.\\
Beyond its applications, robotics appeals to me because of its multidisciplinary nature. It allows for the combination of different exciting fields, such as neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and even aerospace. It is a domain that offers a wide range of opportunities for a curious mind.\\
What truly motivates me is the prospect of realising my own projects. With the knowledge and skills I am acquiring, I aim to bring my ideas to life, independently or in collaboration. It is a stimulating and rewarding challenge to complete a project from A to Z.\\
Alongside my technical skills, I have developed strong project management and team leadership abilities. Through various academic and personal projects, I have demonstrated my capability to create clear and structured conceptual plans, efficiently coordinate team efforts, and maintain effective communication among members. I particularly enjoy the collaborative creation process and can adapt to different profiles and skills to bring out the best in the group. These experiences have taught me to be organised, anticipate challenges, and propose creative solutions to achieve objectives within deadlines.\\
Outside of my studies, I am passionate about music. I have been playing the piano since the age of three and a half, primarily exploring the classical repertoire but also jazz. Music is a central element of my life.\\
In summary, I am a student passionate about science and robotics, eager to use my skills and creativity for meaningful projects. With determination and enthusiasm, I am ready to take on the challenges ahead to achieve my goals and contribute positively in my own way.
